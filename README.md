# Where to clone

## Linux

First go to global config folder

```
cd ~/.config
```

There clone the project. *Don't worry clonning the repo will create nvim folder* 🤭

```
git clone https://github.com/sito8943/sito-nvim-config.git
```

And enjoy 🥳👌

## Windows

First go to the **Local** folder in the **AppData** of your user 
*Note if you don't find **AppData** you should active the hidden files in your explorer settings*

```
cd C:\Users\[YOUR USER NAME]\AppData\Local
```
*Note: Where in [YOUR USER NAME] goes your user name*

There clone the project. *Don't worry clonning the repo will create nvim folder* 🤭

```
git clone https://github.com/sito8943/sito-nvim-config.git
```

And enjoy 🥳👌

## MacOS

Sorry I don't use MacOS yet, be the **first** and make me a PR with that LOL

### Extra notes 👁️

#### Prettier

For `JS`, `JSX`, `JSON`, `JSONC` I will be using **Prettier** so be sure to install it

```
npm install -g prettier
```

and have a file `.prettierrc` in your project root folder 📂
